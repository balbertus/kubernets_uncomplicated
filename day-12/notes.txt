By default, cert-manager will be installed into the cert-manager namespace. It is possible to run cert-manager in a different namespace, although you'll need to make modifications to the deployment manifests.

Once you've installed cert-manager, you can verify it is deployed correctly by checking the cert-manager namespace for running pods:

$ kubectl get pods --namespace cert-manager
