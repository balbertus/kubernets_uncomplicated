> StatefulSet
This is about functions to manage implementations(Deployment) and scaling of pods set, providing garantees over deployments request ans sungularity these pods.
Its opposite of Deployments and Replicasets that work as stateless. Each pod created with statefulset has a persistent sumary and a hostname that linked your identity.
> HeadLess Service
Work together statefulset. This is responsible by allowing comunication between pods across the network while manage the deployment andscaling these pods.

Example:
If you have a Statefulset called application with 3 replica and 1 Headless called nginx, the pods created are application-0, application-1, application-2 and them will have host address (DNS) as:
application-0.nginx.default.svc.cluster.local,
application-1.nginx.default.svc.cluster.local,
application-2.nginx.default.svc.cluster.local,

Its stable and predictable, making easy comunications between different instancies of the same application.
